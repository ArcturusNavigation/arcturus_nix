# arcturus_nix

The easiest way to get started with development on all_seaing_vehicle with native performance, powered by the Nix package manager

> [!NOTE]
> This branch is intended to address https://github.com/ArcturusNavigation/arcturus_nix/issues/5 and https://github.com/ArcturusNavigation/arcturus_nix/issues/1 to turn the proof-of-concept Nix build system into a superjank reality.

## Getting up and running (in less than a minute)

Run the following in a Bash shell on an x86-64 Linux system to build individual Python nodes (simulations and nodes requiring YOLO models will not work).
Use this if you want to be on the bleeding edge of development, build code fast and cut through bloat, and get a taste of [NixOS god complex](https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/kauf1m/dealing_with_post_nixflake_god_complex/).
Note full reproducibility is not guaranteed (yet), but this environment is still quite reproducible and dependency specifications and environment setup is much clearer and easier to change in Nix than in a Docker container.

Do not use this if you don't like Linux, hate Nix, don't like cutting edge technology, and don't want to be part of the software revolution.
You can [run from Nix](https://github.com/ArcturusNavigation/arcturus_docker), but [you can't hide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nix/comments/19a2vqq/anyone_else_replacing_docker_compose_with_nix/).

1. Install the [Nix package manager](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer) (if you install from another source, [make sure flakes are enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Other_Distros,_without_Home-Manager)â€”scroll up for NixOS-specific instructions)
2. Run this in a Bash shell wherever you want to clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArcturusNavigation/arcturus_nix
cd arcturus_nix
git checkout janky
nix develop
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```

3. The last line of the install script should tell you how to run your first node. It should be (note the period):

```bash
. run.sh module_name node.py
```

4. Make sure you run the above command (and any other commands related to running and building nodes) from a Nix devshell (i.e. run `nix develop` prior to running any of these commands). Cloning this repository and updating dependencies are exceptions to this rule (see below).
5. To update your local environment, run this from the `arcturus_nix` directory:

```bash
git pull
nix flake update
nix develop
```

6. In general, after completing steps 1-2, you can run a module for the first time (since entering a devshell) using the command in step 3 and later with:

```bash
ros2 run module_name node.py
```

You can manage the source code for all_seaing_vehicle in `dev_ws/src/all_seaing_vehicle`.

## FAQs

### I have an error running command X. What should I do?

[File an issue](https://github.com/ArcturusNavigation/arcturus_nix/issues/new) as soon as possible so we can fix it.
In the meantime, you can downgrade to the [Docker container](https://github.com/ArcturusNavigation/arcturus_docker) or (even better) setup a Nix environment _inside_ the Docker container (this will require editing the Dockerfile, otherwise any environment changes will be lost).

### Isn't Nix supposed to be perfectly reproducible? Why doesn't it work on my machine?

Note that you are on the `jank` branch. It is aptly named because the build process runs in a devshell, a non-reproducible development environment which simply ensures you have the right versions of certain packages (but not that you have all the packages you need or that your configuration/environment settings are correct).
As of right now, the most reproducible setup might still be to use the Docker container, though work is already underway to migrate from devshells to a Nix package setup, which will ensure perfect reproducibility without the virtualization overhead of Docker.

### Why should I use this instead of the Docker container?

As of right now, this setup does not offer a huge advantage over Docker, but it does have some minor benefits.
Most notably, you don't have to deal with the virtualization (and jank) of Docker (you might even be able to use your GPU!), so builds should be (slightly) faster.
You also get the elegance of Nix, which makes it clear what packages you need as dependencies and what versions of those packages you need, for each module and for the system as a whole.
Nix does this in a much better and more reproducible way than ROS, but, currently, due to the devshell setup, it is impossible to determine whether all necessary packages are included in the Nix environment.

### What is and isn't supported?

Currently, only Python nodes on `x86_64-linux` have been tested.
Other systems will likely not work.
Building almost all nodes intended for local testing (those in paths like `module_name/module_name/node.py`) is supported.
YOLO models and nodes that depend on them, however, are not supported.
Neither is Gazebo (VRX) simulation supported.
Both of these are planned for the future, but ommitted for now due to excess bloat that would cause an unsustainable influx of jank in the Nix build process at this stage in its development.
All nodes should have their dependencies specified, but if a node that isn't listed as unsupported does not build, please [file an issue](https://github.com/ArcturusNavigation/arcturus_nix/issues/new).

### Why is this jank? (alternatively, how jank is it?)

This is jank because it does not follow the Nix philosophy of purely functional (and therefore provable) reproducibility.
Due to the maze of commands and environment variables that need to be set for ROS to build the codebase, it was easiest to setup a Nix environment using devshells (which aren't reproducible but still use Nix packages).
This allows fast iteration and easy testing (so we can add support for more tools with Nix).
We are already working on porting this to a Nix package for pure reproducibility, at which point this repository will surpass [arcturus_docker](https://github.com/ArcturusNavigation/arcturus_docker) in terms of reproducibility and mathematical elegance.
Also, the install script currently clones repositories into an ignored folder, which is highly jank and should be replaced by a git submodule, but due to lack of familiarity with the git dark arts, this will take some time to change.
Nevertheless, it will definitely be completed before (or at the same time as) we migrate to a Nix package.

### Is it any good?

At this point, [debatable](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3067434).
